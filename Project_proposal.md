## Proposal
This document bla bla bla

this project will do heavy use of experimental mechanics.
The purpose of this project will be a remake of ONE of the routes of the very frist chapter of the game Corpse Party as a short proof of concept.

- "Why you decided to remake a shitty JRPG which nobody here even played?? We don't even like horror!"

## Notes
This is the first time I ever used github（ ﾟДﾟ) the formatting was *"inspired"* by Birb's Research Sheet.
