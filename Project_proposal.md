## Introduction
AID Group Scenario is ~as the name says~ a initiative to make a roleplay adventure in the interactive deep-learning-based game called AI Dungeon;
Doing a scenario with over a dozen people can also be called a challenge, as far as the author knows this has never been done before [¹](#¹)



## Objectives
The group's first work will ne to recreate a small part of chapter 1 from Corpse Party, a horror ~walking simulator~ RPG with some visual novel tropes.
Every single line of text used in this scenario will be made publicaly available in this Repo.
